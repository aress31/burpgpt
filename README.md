# burpgpt

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/aress31/burpgpt/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aress31/burpgpt/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml)

`burpgpt` leverages the power of `AI` to detect security vulnerabilities that traditional scanners might miss. It sends web traffic to an `OpenAI` `model` specified by the user, enabling sophisticated analysis within the passive scanner. This extension offers customisable `prompts` that enable tailored web traffic analysis to meet the specific needs of each user. Check out the [Example Use Cases](#example-use-cases) section for inspiration.

The extension generates an automated security report that summarises potential security issues based on the user's `prompt` and real-time data from `Burp`-issued requests. By leveraging `AI` and natural language processing, the extension streamlines the security assessment process and provides security professionals with a higher-level overview of the scanned application or endpoint. This enables them to more easily identify potential security issues and prioritise their analysis, while also covering a larger potential attack surface.

> [!WARNING]
> Data traffic is sent to `OpenAI` for analysis. If you have concerns about this or are using the extension for security-critical applications, it is important to carefully consider this and review [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for further information.

> [!WARNING]
> While the report is automated, it still requires triaging and post-processing by security professionals, as it may contain false positives.

> [!WARNING]
> The effectiveness of this extension is heavily reliant on the [quality and precision of the prompts](#prompt-configuration) created by the user for the selected `GPT` model. This targeted approach will help ensure the `GPT model` generates accurate and valuable results for your security analysis.

## Features

- Adds a `passive scan check`, allowing users to submit `HTTP` data to an `OpenAI`-controlled `GPT model` for analysis through a `placeholder` system.
- Leverages the power of `OpenAI's GPT models` to conduct comprehensive traffic analysis, enabling detection of various issues beyond just security vulnerabilities in scanned applications.
- Enables granular control over the number of `GPT tokens` used in the analysis by allowing for precise adjustments of the `maximum prompt length`.
- Offers users multiple `OpenAI models` to choose from, allowing them to select the one that best suits their needs.
- Empowers users to customise `prompts` and unleash limitless possibilities for interacting with `OpenAI models`. Browse through the [Example Use Cases](#example-use-cases) for inspiration.
- Integrates with `Burp Suite`, providing all native features for pre- and post-processing, including displaying analysis results directly within the Burp UI for efficient analysis.
- Provides troubleshooting functionality via the native `Burp Event Log`, enabling users to quickly resolve communication issues with the `OpenAI API`.

## Requirements

### 1. System requirements

- Operating System: Compatible with `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows` operating systems.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): `Version 11` or later.
- Burp Suite Professional or Community Edition: `Version 2023.3.2` or later.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Please note that using any version lower than `2023.3.2` may result in a [java.lang.NoSuchMethodError](https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/montoya-api-nosuchmethoderror-275048be). It is crucial to use the specified version or a more recent one to avoid this issue.

### 2. Build tool

- Gradle: `Version 6.9` or later (recommended). The [build.gradle](https://github.com/aress31/burpgpt/blob/main/lib/build.gradle) file is provided in the project repository.

### 3. Environment variables

- Set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the `JDK` installation directory.

Please ensure that all system requirements, including a compatible version of `Burp Suite`, are met before building and running the project. Note that the project's external dependencies will be automatically managed and installed by `Gradle` during the build process. Adhering to the requirements will help avoid potential issues and reduce the need for opening new issues in the project repository.

## Installation

### 1. Compilation

1. Ensure you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed and configured.

2. Download the `burpgpt` repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aress31/burpgpt
   cd .\burpgpt\
   ```

3. Build the standalone `jar`:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./gradlew
   ./gradlew shadowJar
   ```

### 2. Loading the Extension Into `Burp Suite`

To install `burpgpt` in `Burp Suite`, first go to the `Extensions` tab and click on the `Add` button. Then, select the `burpgpt-all` jar file located in the `.\lib\build\libs` folder to load the extension.

## Usage

To start using burpgpt, users need to complete the following steps in the Settings panel, which can be accessed from the Burp Suite menu bar:

1. Enter a valid `OpenAI API key`.
2. Select a `model`.
3. Define the `max prompt size`. This field controls the maximum `prompt` length sent to `OpenAI` to avoid exceeding the `maxTokens` of `GPT` models (typically around `2048` for `GPT-3`).
4. Adjust or create custom prompts according to your requirements.

### Prompt Configuration

`burpgpt` enables users to tailor the `prompt` for traffic analysis using a `placeholder` system. To include relevant information, we recommend using these `placeholders`, which the extension handles directly, allowing dynamic insertion of specific values into the `prompt`:

| Placeholder             | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{REQUEST}`             | The scanned request.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `{URL}`                 | The URL of the scanned request.                                                                                                                                            |
| `{METHOD}`              | The HTTP request method used in the scanned request.                                                                                                                       |
| `{REQUEST_HEADERS}`     | The headers of the scanned request.                                                                                                                                        |
| `{REQUEST_BODY}`        | The body of the scanned request.                                                                                                                                           |
| `{RESPONSE}`            | The scanned response.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `{RESPONSE_HEADERS}`    | The headers of the scanned response.                                                                                                                                       |
| `{RESPONSE_BODY}`       | The body of the scanned response.                                                                                                                                          |
| `{IS_TRUNCATED_PROMPT}` | A `boolean` value that is programmatically set to `true` or `false` to indicate whether the `prompt` was truncated to the `Maximum Prompt Size` defined in the `Settings`. |

These `placeholders` can be used in the custom `prompt` to dynamically generate a request/response analysis `prompt` that is specific to the scanned request.

> [!NOTE] > `Burp Suite` provides the capability to support arbitrary `placeholders` through the use of [Session handling rules](https://portswigger.net/support/configuring-burp-suites-session-handling-rules) or extensions such as [Custom Parameter Handler](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/a0c0cd68ab7c4928b3bf0a9ad48ec8c7), allowing for even greater customisation of the `prompts`.
