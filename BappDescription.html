            <li>Supporting vulnerability detection.</li>
            <li>Automating extensive HTTP traffic analysis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        OpenAI results are presented as Informational level issues,
        facilitating efficient large-scale post-processing.
    </li>
    <li>
        An intuitive interface for configuring API keys, models, and prompt settings
        simplifies the security testing process and enhances overall effectiveness.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Event Log's error handling facilitates seamless resolution of
        communication problems with the OpenAI API, including incorrect API keys or
